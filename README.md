# base16-kermit

This repository provides themes for the VTE-based [kermit terminal] and
a simple template that can be used with the [tinted-theming] color
schemes to generate config files.

Have a look at the [Base16 Gallery] to see some examples of the
supported themes.

## Usage

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orhun/base16-kermit/master/themes/base16-default.config > ~/.config/kermit.conf
